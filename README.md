Can't bloody wait for me to finish this? Play the old Typescript version in browser RIGHT NOW at http://itistheegg.com/

The aim of the game is to combine all of the eggs into the One True Egg and also collect all of the things to make your dreams come true and also complete the level and go onto the next.

This is a rewrite in Purescript which seems to be going pretty OK, all told.

```
git clone https://gtithub.com/danieljharvey/it-is-the-purescript-egg
cd it-is-the-purescript-egg
yarn install
```
